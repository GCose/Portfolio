This is a portfolio website I created for my assignment

It's is a portfolio site meant to showcase what I have learnt in the course

I made a repository name change and that caused me to lose the timeline of the old repo which just sucks.

You can check deployments to see the full commit timeline.

This is the new link: https://gcose.github.io/Portfolio/
