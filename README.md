# Introduction to Web Programming I

- This is a portfolio website I created for my assignment.

- It's is a portfolio site meant to showcase what I have learnt in the course.

- I made a repository name change and that caused me to lose the timeline of the old repo which just sucks.

- You can check deployments to see the full commit timeline.
